First me check the whole table:

```
SELECT *
FROM marketing_data;
```
### Nulls:
```
SELECT 
  Education, 
  Income 
FROM 
  marketing_data 
WHERE 
  Income IS NULL; -- 24 NULL records on [Income]
```

Using **Union** to check for other Null Values: 
```


SELECT 
  ID AS TableName, 
  * 
FROM 
  marketing_data 
WHERE 
  ID IS NULL 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 
  Income AS TableName, 
  * 
FROM 
  marketing_data 
WHERE 
  Income IS NULL 
UNION 
SELECT 
  [Marital_Status] AS TableName, 
  * 
FROM 
  marketing_data 
WHERE 
  [Marital_Status] IS NULL 
UNION 
SELECT 
  [Country] AS TableName, 
  * 
FROM 
  marketing_data 
WHERE 
  [Country] IS NULL
;
```
- After Checking the Table, the NULL values we've got are **only** the 24 rows of [Income]
- We calculate the average income per [Education] category, with the goal of replacing the NULL values.
```
SELECT 
[Education],
AVG(INCOME) AS avg_income
FROM marketing_data
GROUP BY [Education] ;
```

```


WITH cte1 As
(
SELECT 
	ID,
    Education,
    CASE 
        WHEN Education = 'Graduation' AND Income IS NULL THEN 52720 
        WHEN Education = 'PhD' AND Income IS NULL THEN 56145
		WHEN Education = 'Master' AND Income IS NULL THEN 52917
		WHEN Education = '2n Cycle' AND Income IS NULL THEN 47633
		WHEN Education = 'Basic' AND Income IS NULL THEN 20306  
        ELSE Income 
    END AS INCOME 
FROM marketing_data
WHERE Income IS NULL 
) ;

### Outliers

- Income:

```
Select *
FROM
(SELECT 
ID,
Education,
Marital_Status,
Income,
(Income- AVG(Income) OVER()) / STDEV(Income) OVER() AS zscore 
FROM marketing_data
) AS score_table
WHERE zscore > 2.576 or zscore <-2.576  ;
```

- Year_Birth:

```
Select *
FROM
(SELECT 
ID,
Year_Birth,
Income,
(Year_Birth- AVG(Year_Birth) OVER()) / STDEV(Year_Birth) OVER() AS zscore 
FROM marketing_data 
) AS score_table
WHERE zscore > 2.576 or zscore <-2.576 ;
```
